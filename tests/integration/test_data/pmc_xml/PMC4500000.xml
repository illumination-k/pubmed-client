        <p>[Purpose] This study investigated the effects of a multifactorial fall prevention program
on balance, gait, and fear of falling in stroke patients. [Subjects] Twenty-five stroke
patients were divided randomly into multifactorial fall prevention program group (n=15)
and control treadmill group (n=10). [Methods] All interventions were applied for 30 min,
five times per week, for five weeks. The fall prevention program included interventions
based on the “Step Up to Stop Falls” initiative and educational interventions based on the
Department of Health guidelines. For those in the treadmill group, the speed was increased
gradually. The Korean falls efficacy scale and Korean activities-specific balance
confidence scale were used to assess fear of falling. To assess balance and walking
ability, the Korean performance-oriented mobility assessment scale and the 10-m and
6-minute walk tests were used. [Results] The fall prevention program interventions were
found to be very effective at improving gait, balance, and fear of falling compared with
the treadmill intervention and therefore seem appropriate for stroke patients.
[Conclusion] A multifactorial fall prevention program is effective at improving balance,
gait ability, and fear of falling. It is a more specific and broad intervention for
reducing falls among inpatients in facilities and hospitals.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Stroke manifestations vary depending on the lesion site and severity. Development of
hemiplegia causes difficulties in weight bearing on the affected side and maintaining
balance, both of which are required for correct posture. An imbalanced posture results in
instability during standing, muscle weakness, and a limited range of motion. These features
are predictive of an increased likelihood of falls and decreased gait ability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The risk of falls may increase after a
patient has experienced one fall, even in the absence of physical damage, because of an
increased fear of falling<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Schoenfelder
et al. suggested that fall prevention education and muscle strengthening can decrease the
fear of falling and risk of falls<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. A fall
prevention program that includes balance, muscle strengthening, and flexibility training is
effective for improving gait, balance ability, and perception of the risk of falling<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because falls have multiple causes,
multifactorial interventions including patient education and improvement of muscle strength,
balance, and gait are required for fall prevention. However, most fall prevention programs
consist of a single item, and because falls are influenced by physical, psychological,
environmental, and social factors, an effective fall prevention program would include
exercise and educational interventions<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Although many studies have reported ways to prevent falls<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, the subjects in these
investigations were elderly people in the community, and only a single program was applied.
Fall prevention interventions have to begin in high-risk facilities and hospitals<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
study baseline data and decrease the risk of falls using a multifactorial fall prevention
program (MFPP) in post-stroke patients.</p>

      <title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title>
      <p>Thirty patients (16 males, 14 females) who had experienced a stroke within the previous
year at the M hospital in Seoul-Si were included. Based on previous studies, the following
inclusion criteria were used: age &lt;65 years, able to walk independently, Korean
mini-mental state examination (MMSE-K) score &gt;24, and able to understand the study
procedures and communicate<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exclusion
criteria were medication use, which can influence gait ability and balance, visual deficits,
and vestibular impairment. This study used a randomized two-group pretest-posttest design.
Subjects were randomly allocated to the MFPP group (n=15, MFPG) or treadmill exercise group
(n=15, TEG). Five patients were excluded from the MFPG. From the TEG, 1 male and 3 female
patients were excluded due to discharge before completion of the experiment, and 1 female
patient was excluded for personal reasons. The randomization was generated by a computer
drawing lots. All study procedures were explained to the subjects prior to participation,
and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. This study was approved by the
Sahmyook University Institutional Review Board.</p>
      <p>Before the intervention program, the subjects’ gait speed and endurance were assessed using
the Korean performance-oriented motor assessment (POMA-K) scale<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, 10-m walk test, and 6-min walk test. The Korean falls
efficacy scale<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> (FES-K) and Korean
activities-specific balance confidence<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>
(ABC-K) scale were used to assess the balance self-assurance of the patients. The
multifactorial exercise program included education regarding fall prevention,
neuro-developmental treatment (NDT), and training for muscle strengthening, balance, and
flexibility. It was carried out for 30 min per day, five times a week, over a 5-week period.
The treadmill exercise program included NDT and treadmill exercise, with a 0.4 km/h increase
in speed per week. The details of both exercise programs are described in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Multifactorial fall prevention program</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exercise type</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time (sets/duration)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="10" colspan="1">Exercise</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strengthening intervention</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Calf stretching</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30–60 sec 5 repetitions</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Heel/Toe raise</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5–10 sec</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Marching</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Floor/Stairs</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SLR: forward, side, backward</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5–10 sec, 10 repetitions, 3 sets</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Leg curl</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">In sitting on chair</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Balance intervention</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ankle ROM exercise</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Draw A to Z</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Standing on air cushion</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Up and down the leg alternately</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diagonal movement exercise</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">In holding both hands with trunk rotation</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Flexibility intervention</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Standing with head movement</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">General standing 30 sec Tandem standing 30 sec</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Standing on balance pad</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Eye open/close</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Education</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Regulation of fall Environmental factor</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before starting exercise for 5 minutes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">General physical therapy</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NDT<break/>PNF</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">General stretching and strengthening<break/>Static and dynamic balance

      <p>The SPSS version 19.0 statistical software was used for all analyses. Statistics were used
to describe patient characteristics after confirming that the data were normally
distributed. A comparison of the general characteristics was performed using the independent
t-test or χ<sup>2</sup> test. Pre- and post-data were analyzed using the paired t-test to
test differences within the groups. Scheffé’s post-hoc test was used to test the
significance of differences between the groups. A significance level of 0.05 was used for
all measurements.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>This study aimed to investigate the effects of an MFPP comprised of exercise and
educational interventions for improving balance, gait, as well as fear of falling, and to
provide a suitable approach for use of a fall prevention program in stroke inpatients.
Guidelines for fall prevention in the United States and Britain suggest that a
multifactorial program, involving exercise and educational interventions, is more effective
than a single intervention, and that fall prevention programs have to be focused on
physiological and psychological factors such as fear of falling<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because exercise interventions alone cannot improve FES
scores, exercise and educational intervention are needed for individuals at a high risk for
falls<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Tinetti studied the benefits of
multifactorial interventions for muscle strengthening and improvement of balance and
self-confidence in comparison to those of a single intervention. They recommend an MFPP,
because physical and occupational therapists alone cannot control falls or reduce the fear
of falling<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>In this study, the MFPG showed significant improvements in physical activity and FES-K
scores, as shown in other studies<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The POMA-K scale score, which is focused on mobility, significantly
increased in the MFPG (p&lt;0.01), and this result indicates a greater increase than that
seen in previous studies<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. For gait
ability, the 10-m walk test and 6-min walk test were used in this study. The MFPG had a
significantly increased 10-m walk test score (p&lt;0.01) and 6-min walk test score
(p&lt;0.01), but the TEG showed a significant increase only in the 10-m walk test score
(p&lt;0.05). Because fall prevention exercise interventions increase balance ability and
strengthen muscles, the risk of falls is decreased by 15–20%<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the 6-min walk test score, used to assess
functional capacity in older adults<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>,
significantly increased in the MFPG. Therefore, it can be seen that an MFPP positively
influences walking ability and aerobic capacity.</p>
      <p>Batchelor et al. suggested that an MFPP improves balance (p&lt;0.01), gait speed
(p&lt;0.01), and the FES score (p&lt;0.05) in stroke patients returning home after
rehabilitation<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Their results show
that exercise and educational interventions have to be used together to reduce the fear of
falling. Our study demonstrates that an MFPP was effective at improving FES-K scores
(p&lt;0.05), and the treadmill exercise was not (p&gt;0.05). In addition, the FES-K score
was significantly different between the groups (p&lt;0.05). The ABC-K scale, a more
objective evaluation of the fear of falling, showed the same results as the FES-K (MFPG
p&lt;0.01, TEG p&gt;0.05). In other words, exercise intervention improved balance and gait
ability, and educational intervention improved the psychological aspect of the fear of
falling. Cumming et al. reported that home visits can prevent falls among older people who
are at increased risk of falling. However, this effect may not be the result of improved
balance and strength alone, but also due to a decreased fear of falling<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The risk of falling within 12 months in those with a
decreased FES score was half that in patients whose FES score had not decreased<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, interventions for fall
prevention need to begin at hospital facilities, and programs must consist of a variety of
approaches. Using the ABC-K scale with the FES scale is an efficient method of evaluating
the fear of outdoor activities as well as indoor activities<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p>
      <p>While this study demonstrates the effectiveness of an MFPP, it has some limitations. First,
although balance, gait ability and FES scores significantly improved after the MFPP, it can
be difficult to prove the frequency of falls using these factors alone; the validity of this
study is therefore limited. Second, a reduction in fall frequency is the eventual goal, but
an intervention period of 5 weeks is too short to allow an assessment of this factor. It is
therefore suggested that further studies include longer intervention and follow-up
periods.</p>
