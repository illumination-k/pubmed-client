# WebAssembly Implementation Status

## What's Completed

### 1. Infrastructure Setup ✅

- Added all necessary WASM dependencies to `Cargo.toml`
- Configured WebAssembly compilation target (`cdylib`, `rlib`)
- Set up conditional compilation for WASM vs native targets
- Added `wasm-pack` build configuration

### 2. WASM API Bindings ✅

- Created comprehensive WASM module (`src/wasm.rs`)
- Implemented JavaScript-compatible data structures:
  - `JsArticle` - Simplified article representation
  - `JsFullText` - Full-text article structure
  - `JsAuthor`, `JsJournal`, `JsSection`, `JsReference` - Supporting types
- Added conversion implementations between Rust and JavaScript types
- Created `WasmClientConfig` for JavaScript-friendly configuration
- Implemented `WasmPubMedClient` with async Promise-based API

### 3. Package Configuration ✅

- Created `package.json` with proper WASM build scripts
- Set up npm package structure and metadata
- Configured multiple build targets (Node.js, web, bundler)

### 4. Documentation & Examples ✅

- Comprehensive README with API documentation
- TypeScript definitions for full type safety
- Complete usage example (`examples/wasm_example.js`)
- Detailed method documentation and error handling

### 5. Core API Methods ✅

**Implemented WASM bindings for:**

- `search_articles(query, limit)` - Article search
- `fetch_article(pmid)` - Single article retrieval
- `fetch_full_text(pmcid)` - PMC full-text access
- `check_pmc_availability(pmid)` - PMC availability check
- `convert_to_markdown(full_text)` - Markdown conversion
- `get_related_articles(pmids)` - Related article discovery

## Current Status: 80% Complete

The WASM implementation is **nearly complete** with all major components in place. The main remaining issue is compilation compatibility.

## Remaining Work

### 1. Compilation Issues (High Priority)

**Problem:** The existing Rust codebase uses features not available in WASM:

- `tokio::sync::Mutex` (not available in WASM target)
- `reqwest` timeout configuration (different in WASM)
- Network features that require `mio` (incompatible with WASM)

**Solution Options:**

#### Option A: Conditional Compilation (Recommended)

```rust
#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
use tokio::sync::Mutex;

#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
use std::sync::Mutex;

// Similar patterns for other WASM-incompatible features
```

#### Option B: Simplified WASM-Only Implementation

Create a minimal WASM-specific client that bypasses complex features like:

- Advanced rate limiting (use simple delays)
- Complex HTTP client configuration
- Async synchronization primitives

### 2. Build Script Modifications (Medium Priority)

**Needed:**

- Update rate limiting module for WASM compatibility
- Modify HTTP client configuration for WASM target
- Add feature flags to disable problematic functionality in WASM builds

### 3. Testing & Validation (Medium Priority)

**Needed:**

- Real WASM build testing
- Integration tests with Node.js
- Browser compatibility verification
- Performance benchmarking

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Dependencies Resolution

The `Cargo.toml` has been structured with target-specific dependencies:

```toml
[target.'cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))'.dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
tokio-retry = "0.3"
tokio-util = "0.7"

[target.'cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")'.dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["macros", "rt", "time"], default-features = false }
```

### WASM Feature Flag

```toml
[features]
wasm = [
  "wasm-bindgen",
  "wasm-bindgen-futures",
  "js-sys",
  "web-sys",
  "serde-wasm-bindgen",
  "console_error_panic_hook",
  "wee_alloc",
  "getrandom",
]
```

## Estimated Completion Time

**With Option A (Conditional Compilation):** 4-6 hours

- Fix rate limiting for WASM compatibility
- Update HTTP client configuration
- Add conditional compilation directives
- Test and validate builds

**With Option B (Simplified Implementation):** 2-3 hours

- Create simplified WASM-only versions of problematic modules
- Bypass complex async synchronization
- Test basic functionality

## Build Commands (When Complete)

```bash
# Build for Node.js
npm run build

# Build for web browsers
npm run build:web

# Build for bundlers (webpack, etc.)
npm run build:bundler

# Build all targets
npm run build:all

# Test WASM module
npm run test
```

## Package Publication (When Ready)

```bash
# After successful build
wasm-pack pack
npm publish pkg/
```

## Next Steps for Completion

1. **Choose implementation approach** (Option A recommended)
2. **Fix compilation issues** with conditional compilation
3. **Test WASM build** with `wasm-pack build`
4. **Validate functionality** with example usage
5. **Publish to npm** as `pubmed-client-wasm`

The foundation is solid and the API design is complete. The remaining work is primarily about resolving target-specific compilation issues.
